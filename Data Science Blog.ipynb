       "2  Upper Queen Anne is a charming neighborhood full of a mix of beautifully maintained, turn-of-the-century craftsman homes, tudors and modern homes.  The \"main drag\" is Queen Anne Ave. with a great selection of boutiques, restaurants, coffee shops and bars.  Upper Queen Anne is just 1.5 miles from downtown Seattle, and situated on a hilltop with stunning panoramic views in every direction -- downtown Seattle, the Space Needle and Mt. Rainier to the southeast, Elliott Bay to the southwest, the Olympic Mountains to the west and the Cascade Mountains to the east. If you're a walker, you'll love the 4-mile \"Crown of Queen Anne\" loop which takes in all of these views!\n",

       "1  What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if you leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that \n",

       "9  What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if you leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that "

       "1  Kelly has a great room in a very central location. \\r\\nBeautiful building , architecture and a style that we really like. \\r\\nWe felt guite at home here and wish we had spent more time.\\r\\nWent for a walk and found Seattle Center with a major food festival in progress. What a treat.\\r\\nVisited the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass exhibit. Then Pikes Place Market. WOW.  Thanks for a great stay.  \n",
       "2      Very spacious apartment, and in a great neighborhood.  This is the kind of apartment I wish I had!\\r\\n\\r\\nDidn't really get to meet Kelly until I was on my out, but she was always readily available by phone. \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the only \"issue\" (if you want to call it that) was finding a place to park, but I sincerely doubt its easy to park anywhere in a residential area after 5 pm on a Friday  \n",

Easy to find and Kelly was warm, welcoming, and really interesting to talk to.   \n",

She has some great coffee and while I wasn't around much during my stay the time I spent interacting with her was very pleasant. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is in a great location and very close to the Seattle Center. The neighborhood itself has a lot of good food as well!  "
